solutions to codingbat exercises in Swift and Java

Codingbat code practice was created by Nick Parlante, a computer science lecturer at Stanford. It is designed to help you do as many practice problems as possible in a short time to solidify basic skills. Before I knew a single line of code, this was where I started.

The website, however, only supports Java and Python. To write solutions in Swift, use the IBM Swift Sandbox:

Overtime, I will be adding solutions to problems in Swift 3 and Java.
